# Waste Classification
## Project Overview
This project is a waste classification system that categorizes waste into organic and recyclable materials using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on an image dataset of different waste types to enhance waste management efficiency.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images categorized into:  
1. Organic Waste (e.g., food scraps, leaves, vegetable peels)    
2. Recyclable Waste (e.g., plastic bottles, paper, metal cans)

## Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture
- Convolutional layers extract important features from images.
- MaxPooling layers reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information.
- Flatten layer converts extracted features into a one-dimensional vector.
- Fully connected layers process the features for classification.
- Sigmoid activation function determines the category of waste.
